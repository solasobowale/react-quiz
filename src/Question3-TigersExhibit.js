/*
 * ============= Question 3 =============
 *
 * The TigersExhibit component below receives 2 props:
 * - population which is a number
 * - habitats which is an array
 *
 * Part A: Replace the dots (...) in the paragraph (<p>) element below with the
 * population prop.
 *
 * Part B: Replace the comment in the unordered list (<ul>) element below with a
 * list element (<li>) element for every habitat in the habitats prop
 *
 * HINT 1: you can transform an array using the .map method
 * HINT 2: when you are rendering a list in React, remember that you need to
 * provide a key prop which tells React which list item is which
